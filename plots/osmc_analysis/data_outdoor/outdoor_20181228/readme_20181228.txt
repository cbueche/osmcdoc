Readme outdoor measurements 2018-12-28

These measurements are a follow-up to the 2018-12-27 tower measurements to figure out why the woofer response shows such large peaks and dips in the 400 Hz range

Measurements done with microphone at 100cm and 50cm from baffle.

- Are the peaks/dips due to a resonance in the beer crates used as part of the tower/stand for the box on 2018-12-27? --> replaced beer crates by chair/stool. Microphone on axis relative to woofer, about 245cm above floor.
Result: peaks/dips are reduced a lot, but not removed.

- Is the remaining effect a resonance between the box-bottom/chair-top and the pallette on which the chair stands?
--> stuffed "inside" of chair with pillows. Result: no change
--> removed chair (box directly on palette), box and microphone closer to floor (mic 200cm above floor). Result: no change
Conclusion: there is no "chair resonance".

- Is the effect related to the bass reflex tunnel?
--> stuffed bass-reflex port with scarf. Result: peaks + dips are mostly gone!

Conclusion: the peaks/dips around 400 Hz are resonances related to the bass-reflex port!
